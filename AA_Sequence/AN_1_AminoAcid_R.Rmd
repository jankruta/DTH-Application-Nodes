### Simulation of Antibody Sequence 110 amino acids long

#### To learn (Antibody):

Antibodies are immune system-related proteins called immunoglobulins. Each antibody consists of four polypeptides-- two heavy chains and two light chains joined to form a "Y" shaped molecule. The amino acid sequence in the tips of the "Y" varies greatly among different antibodies. This variable region, composed of 110-130 amino acids, give the antibody its specificity for binding antigen.

#### To learn (Amino Acids):

Amino acids are chemical connection between an aminogroup (containing N - Nitrogen) and an carbon acid group (containing C - Carbon and O - Oxigen), They are found in all living things and are, amongst other functions, building blocks for proteins. The following 20 amino acids exist

```{r 110aa}
### Amino Acids: GALMFWKQESPVICYHRNDT
library(stringr)
stri_rand_strings(10, 110, '[GALMFWKQESPVICYHRNDT]')

# Needed library: stringi (character string/text/natural language processing tools)
# stri_rand_strings: Generates (pseudo)random strings of desired lengths.
# 1, as the task is to generate one string | 110 as the task is to have it 110char long |GALMFWKQESPVICYHRNDT for AA 
```
